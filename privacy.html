  <section>
    <p class="small">Creative Constructors LLC (“we”, “us”, “Creative Job Hub”) provides the Creative Job Hub mobile application and related services. This Privacy Policy describes the categories of personal data we collect, how we use and share it, how long we retain it, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.</p>
  </section>

  <h2 id="what-we-collect">1. Information we collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following categories of information when you use Creative Job Hub:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account & profile data</strong>: name, email, phone number, company/organization, role, and other profile fields you provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Location data</strong>: precise (GPS) location of technicians to enable live tracking, dispatch, routing, and estimated arrival times.</li>
    <li><strong>Content you upload</strong>: photos, notes, documents and other job-related attachments.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment & billing metadata</strong>: subscription and invoice metadata. Payments are processed by <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a>; Creative Job Hub does not store full card numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Device, log & usage data</strong>: device identifiers, OS version, crash reports, diagnostic and analytics data used to improve the app and troubleshoot issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Communications</strong>: messages, SMS, and email content when you use in-app messaging or we send service messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-we-use">2. How we use information</h2>
  <p>We use personal data to provide, maintain, and improve the Service, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Core functionality: scheduling, dispatch, job management, maps, and live technician tracking.</li>
    <li>Payments & invoices: processing subscriptions and payments via Stripe.</li>
    <li>Communications: service messages, job notifications, and support.</li>
    <li>Analytics & operations: performance monitoring, crash reporting and product improvement.</li>
    <li>Security & fraud prevention.</li>
    <li>Legal obligations and compliance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="location">3. Location collection and use (important)</h2>
  <p>We collect <strong>precise location</strong> (GPS) of technicians only with their explicit permission. Location enables live tracking, dispatch, routing, and time-on-site calculations. Typical location usage patterns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collected while a technician is on an active job or when they explicitly enable tracking.</li>
    <li>Used for route optimization, arrival estimates, and display on the Jobs Map.</li>
    <li>Users can stop location collection by disabling location permissions for the app in device settings or by toggling tracking off in the app (where available).</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="databox">
    <strong>Suggested location retention:</strong> location data is retained for up to <strong>30 days</strong> after job completion for troubleshooting and dispute resolution, unless you request deletion sooner.
  </div>

  <h2 id="third-parties">4. Third parties and processors</h2>
  <p>We use third-party service providers to operate the Service. These processors act on our behalf under contract and only process data as instructed by us. Major providers include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://supabase.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supabase</a> — backend & database (data storage).</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mapbox</a> — maps and geolocation services.</li>
    <li><a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> — payment processing.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilio</a> — SMS and communications.</li>
    <li><a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sentry</a> or <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Firebase</a> — optional crash reporting / analytics (if used).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may share data with law enforcement or in response to legal process when required by law.</p>

  <h2 id="retention">5. Data retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business, legal, and tax purposes. Typical retention periods (you may adjust these to fit your policies):</p>
  <table>

      <tr><td>Account & profile</td><td>Until account deletion + 1 year</td></tr>

  </table>

  <h2 id="security">6. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard protections such as TLS for data in transit and access controls for stored data. We limit access to personal data on a need-to-know basis. While we strive to protect data, no method is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2 id="international">7. International transfers</h2>
  <p>Your data may be stored or processed in countries other than your country of residence (for example, servers in the United States). We take appropriate safeguards to protect personal data when transferred internationally (contractual protections, standard contractual clauses where required).</p>

  <h2 id="user-rights">8. Your choices and rights</h2>
  <p>You may request access, correction, restriction, or deletion of your personal data by emailing <strong>hello@creativejobhub.com</strong>. We will verify requests and respond in accordance with applicable law. To stop location tracking, disable the app’s location permission in your device settings or turn off tracking in the app.</p>

  <h2 id="payments">9. Payments</h2>
  <p>We process payments using <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a>. We do not store full credit card numbers on our servers. For payment disputes or refunds, contact support.</p>

  <h2 id="children">10. Children</h2>
  <p>This app is intended for professional use and is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or local minimum age). If you believe a child has provided personal data without parental consent, contact us and we will remove the information.</p>

  <h2 id="changes">11. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the revised policy with an updated “Last updated” date.</p>
