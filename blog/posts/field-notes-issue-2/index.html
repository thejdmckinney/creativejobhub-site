      <h2>The Follow-Up System That Tripled My Recurring Revenue</h2>
      <p>Last week, I told you about the $10,000 mistake I made chasing expensive software and flashy marketing.</p>
      <p>This week, I want to share the single strategy that had a bigger impact on my bottom line than any tool or tactic I ever paid for.</p>
      <p>And it didn't cost me a dime to implement.</p>
      <p>I'm talking about following up with customers - not just once, but with an actual system that turns one-time jobs into recurring revenue.</p>
      <h3>The Money I Was Leaving on the Table</h3>
      <p>Here's what my business looked like in year one:</p>
      <p>I'd fix someone's leaky faucet. They'd pay me. I'd move on to the next job. Rinse and repeat.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, someone would call me back months later for another issue. But most of the time? I never heard from them again.</p>
      <p>I was working my tail off, constantly hunting for new customers, constantly bidding on new jobs. It felt like I was always starting from scratch.</p>
      <p>Then one day, I was talking to a buddy who runs an HVAC company. He mentioned that 60% of his revenue comes from maintenance contracts - customers who pay him monthly or annually to keep their systems running.</p>
      <p>"Wait," I said. "You mean they just... keep paying you? Without you having to find new work?"</p>
      <p>He laughed. "Yeah man, that's how you build a real business." That conversation changed everything.</p>
      <h3>The Realization That Changed My Business</h3>
      <p>I started looking at my past jobs differently. How many of those customers could have become recurring clients if I'd just... asked?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The lady whose deck I repaired? She probably needs gutter cleaning twice a year.</li>
        <li>The family whose bathroom I remodeled? Their HVAC filters need changing quarterly.</li>
        <li>The homeowner whose fence I fixed? Lawn care, seasonal maintenance, weatherproofing - the list goes on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I was doing one-off jobs for people who had ongoing needs. And I was just walking away.</p>
      <p>The math was painful to think about. If just 20% of my customers became recurring maintenance clients at $100-200/month, that would be an extra $2,000-4,000 in predictable monthly revenue.</p>
      <p>But I wasn't following up. I wasn't offering maintenance plans. I was treating my business like a gig instead of building something sustainable.</p>
      <h3>The System I Built (And You Can Steal)</h3>
      <p>I developed a simple follow-up system that I still use today. It's not complicated, but it's consistent - and that's what matters.</p>
      <strong>Immediately After Job Completion:</strong>
      <p>Within 24 hours of finishing a job, I send a thank-you message. Not automated corporate speak - a real message:</p>
      <blockquote>"Thanks for trusting me with your deck repair. It was great working with you. If anything comes up or you need help with future projects, don't hesitate to reach out."</blockquote>
      <p>Simple. Personal. Keeps the door open.</p>
      <strong>Two Weeks Later - The Service Plan Offer:</strong>
      <p>This is where the magic happens. After they've had time to appreciate the work but before they forget about you, I reach out with a service plan offer:</p>
      <blockquote>"Hey [Name], hope the deck is holding up great! I wanted to reach out because a lot of my clients in [neighborhood] have been asking about seasonal maintenance plans. I'm offering quarterly check-ups that include gutter cleaning, deck inspection/treatment, and weatherproofing. It's $XXX every three months, and it keeps your home in great shape year-round. Would this be helpful for you?"</blockquote>
      <p>About 15-20% of customers say yes. That might not sound like much, but those are customers who keep paying you without you having to bid, market, or hunt for work.</p>
      <strong>30 Days Later - The Referral Request:</strong>
      <p>If they didn't bite on the service plan, I follow up with a referral request:</p>
      <blockquote>"Hey [Name], I hope everything's still going well with the deck. If you were happy with my work, I'd really appreciate if you could refer me to any neighbors or friends who might need help with home projects. Word of mouth is how I grow my business, and I always take care of people you send my way."</blockquote>
      <p>This alone has brought me dozens of jobs over the years.</p>
      <strong>Quarterly Check-Ins:</strong>
      <p>Even for customers who didn't sign up for a service plan, I check in every quarter with something helpful:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spring: "Time for gutter cleaning and deck treatment season"</li>
        <li>Summer: "Just a reminder about HVAC maintenance before the heat hits"</li>
        <li>Fall: "Getting ready for winter? Here's what you should weatherproof"</li>
        <li>Winter: "Check your pipes and insulation - I'm booking winter prep jobs now"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm not selling - I'm being helpful. But when they need work done, who do you think they call?</p>
      <h3>The Results (And Why This Works)</h3>
      <p>After implementing this system consistently for 18 months, here's what happened:</p>
      <strong>Before the follow-up system:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>95% one-time customers</li>
        <li>Constantly chasing new leads</li>
        <li>Revenue up and down every month</li>
        <li>Stressful, unpredictable income</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>After the follow-up system:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>35% repeat/recurring customers</li>
        <li>Steady base of maintenance contracts</li>
        <li>Predictable monthly revenue from service plans</li>
        <li>Referrals coming in without asking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My recurring revenue went from basically $0 to over $6,000/month. That's money I can count on before I book a single new job.</p>
      <p>But here's the real benefit: <strong>Peace of mind.</strong></p>
      <p>When you have recurring customers, you're not starting from zero every month. You have a foundation. You can plan. You can grow strategically instead of just surviving.</p>
      <h3>Why Most Contractors Don't Do This</h3>
      <p>I'll be honest - this system takes discipline. It's easy to finish a job, get paid, and move on to the next one. Following up feels like extra work.</p>
      <p>But here's the thing: finding NEW customers is way harder than keeping existing ones.</p>
      <p>A new customer doesn't know you, doesn't trust you yet, and is comparing you to three other bids. An existing customer already knows you do good work. They're warm leads who are way more likely to say yes.</p>
      <p>The reason most contractors don't follow up isn't that they don't want to - it's that they forget, or they don't have a system, or they're too busy.</p>
      <p>I was the same way until I built a system that made it automatic.</p>
      <h3>How I Actually Execute This Now</h3>
      <p>In the beginning, I did all of this manually. I'd set reminders on my phone, keep a spreadsheet, send texts and emails when I remembered.</p>
      <p>It worked, but it was clunky and I'd miss people.</p>
      <p>Now? I built this follow-up workflow directly into Creative Job Hub. When I complete a job, the system automatically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Schedules the 24-hour thank-you</li>
        <li>Sets up the 2-week service plan offer</li>
        <li>Reminds me about the 30-day referral request</li>
        <li>Creates quarterly check-in tasks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I can also set up actual service plans in the platform - recurring maintenance contracts that automatically bill clients monthly or quarterly. The system tracks what services are included, when they're due, and sends me reminders so nothing falls through the cracks.</p>
      <p>The AI insights even show me which customers are most likely to convert to service plans based on their job history and engagement.</p>
      <p>But you don't need software to start. You can do this with a simple spreadsheet and phone reminders. The system is what matters, not the tools.</p>
      <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>One-time jobs are great. Recurring revenue is better.</p>
      <p>Every single customer you complete a job for is a potential recurring client. They have ongoing maintenance needs. They have friends who need work done. They will hire a contractor again - the question is whether it'll be you or someone else.</p>
      <p>Don't leave that money on the table.</p>
      <p>Build a simple follow-up system. Offer service plans. Stay in touch. Be helpful.</p>
      <p>The contractors who do this consistently are the ones who build real, sustainable businesses. The ones who don't are always hustling for the next job.</p>
      <p><strong>Which one do you want to be?</strong></p>
      <hr>
      <h3>What's Next?</h3>
      <p>In the next issue of Field Notes, I'll share the exact pricing structure I use for service plans and how to present them to customers so they actually say yes.</p>
      <p>If you've tried offering maintenance plans before and struggled to get buy-in, hit reply and tell me what happened. I read every response and I'll address the most common objections in the next issue.</p>
